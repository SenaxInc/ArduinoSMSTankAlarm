      "sampleSeconds": 1800,
      "tanks": [
        {
          "id": "A",
          "name": "North Tank",
          "highAlarm": 110.0,
          "lowAlarm": 18.0
        }
      ]
    }
  }'
```

## Configuration

### Server Configuration

Stored in `/server_config.json` on LittleFS. Default values:

```json
{
  "serverName": "Tank Alarm Server",
  "clientFleet": "tankalarm-clients",
  "smsPrimary": "+12223334444",
  "smsSecondary": "+15556667777",
  "smsTertiary": "",
  "emailPrimary": "alerts@example.com",
  "emailSecondary": "",
  "dailyReportHour": 7,
  "dailyReportMinute": 0
}
```

### Client Configuration Cache

The server caches configuration for each client in `/client_configs/<device-uid>.json`. This allows the dashboard to display current client settings.

## Operation

### Data Flow

1. **Clients → Server**:
   - Clients send telemetry, alarms, and daily reports
   - Data routed via Blues Notehub using fleet targeting
   - Server receives notes in `.qi` inbox files

2. **Server Processing**:
   - Polls Notecard for incoming notes every 5 seconds
   - Processes telemetry to update dashboard
   - Handles alarms and triggers SMS/email
   - Aggregates daily reports

3. **Server → Clients**:
   - Configuration updates pushed from web interface
   - Routed via Blues Notehub using device-specific targeting
   - Clients receive and apply configuration immediately

### Alert Processing

When an alarm is received:
1. Server detects alarm in incoming `alarm.qi` note
2. Composes SMS message with tank details
3. Queues SMS for delivery via Blues Notehub
4. Updates dashboard to show alarm status
5. Logs alarm in system memory

### Daily Reports

The server generates daily reports:
1. Aggregates data from all clients at scheduled time
2. Formats email with current levels and changes
3. Queues email for delivery via Blues Notehub
4. Includes alarm history and status summary

## Communication

### Notes Received from Clients

1. **Telemetry** (`telemetry.qi`)
   - Tank levels and sensor data
   - Timestamp and client identifier
   - Used to update dashboard

2. **Alarms** (`alarm.qi`)
   - Immediate notification of threshold breach
   - Tank ID, name, level, threshold
   - Triggers SMS/email alerts

3. **Daily Reports** (`daily.qi`)
   - Once per day summary
   - All tanks and status
   - Used for email reporting

### Notes Sent to Clients

1. **Configuration** (`config.qi`)
   - Pushed from web interface
   - Device-specific targeting: `device:<uid>:config.qi`
   - Contains updated settings for client

2. **SMS Requests** (`sms.qo`)
   - Outbound SMS via Blues Notehub integration
   - Can be routed to Twilio or other SMS provider

3. **Email Requests** (`email.qo`)
   - Outbound email via Blues Notehub integration
   - Can be routed to SendGrid or other email provider

## Troubleshooting

### Cannot Access Dashboard

**Check Network Connection:**
- Verify Ethernet cable is connected
- Check link lights on Ethernet port
- Ensure server obtained IP via DHCP
- Check serial monitor for IP address

**Check Firewall:**
- Allow port 80 through firewall
- Verify computer is on same network/subnet
- Try accessing from different device

**Check Server Status:**
- Serial monitor should show "Server listening on port 80"
- Try pinging the IP address
- Verify power supply is adequate

### Dashboard Shows No Data

**Verify Client Communication:**
- Check that clients have checked in (sample interval)
- Verify fleet configuration in Blues Notehub
- Check Blues Notehub Events for note traffic
- Confirm clients are configured with correct server fleet

**Check Server Processing:**
- Serial monitor shows "Polling for client data..."
- Verify Notecard is connected and syncing
- Check that server is in correct fleet

### Cannot Update Client Config

**Verify Client UID:**
- Copy UID directly from Blues Notehub device page
- Format: `dev:xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx`
- Check for typos or truncation

**Check Notehub Configuration:**
- Verify client is assigned to correct fleet
- Check that client is online and syncing
- Review Events for config note delivery

**Check Network:**
- Ensure server can communicate with Notecard
- Verify I2C connection to Notecard
- Check serial monitor for error messages

### SMS/Email Not Sending

**Configure Downstream Routes:**
- SMS and email require additional Blues Notehub routes
- Route `sms.qo` to Twilio or SMS provider
- Route `email.qo` to SendGrid or email provider
- See Blues Notehub documentation for route setup

**Verify Phone Numbers/Emails:**
- Check format in server configuration
- Phone: +1XXXXXXXXXX format
- Email: valid email addresses
- Test with known good numbers/addresses

## Development

### Serial Console Output
Monitor at 115200 baud for diagnostic information:
- Server startup and IP assignment
- Notecard connection status
- Incoming note processing
- Configuration updates
- Alarm processing
- Error messages

### Memory Usage
- Flash: ~70-85% (server is larger than client)
- RAM: ~50-70% during operation
- LittleFS: <5KB for all configuration files

### Network Configuration

**Default: DHCP**
The server obtains an IP address automatically.

**Static IP (if needed):**
Modify the code before `Ethernet.begin()`:
```cpp
IPAddress ip(192, 168, 1, 100);
IPAddress dns(192, 168, 1, 1);
IPAddress gateway(192, 168, 1, 1);
IPAddress subnet(255, 255, 255, 0);
Ethernet.begin(mac, ip, dns, gateway, subnet);
```

## Security Considerations

**Intranet Use Only:**
- Read-only pages and `GET` endpoints have no authentication
- Control endpoints are protected by a 4-digit admin PIN once configured
- Designed for trusted local networks only
- Do not expose port 80 to internet
- Use firewall rules to restrict access

**For Internet Access:**
- Implement authentication (not included) and avoid exposing the Opta directly
- Use HTTPS with valid certificates
- Consider VPN for remote access
- Add rate limiting and input validation
