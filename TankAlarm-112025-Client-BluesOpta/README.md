### 4-20mA Current Loop Sensor Configuration

For 4-20mA current loop sensors, two mounting options are supported. The implementation uses the sensor's **native measurement range** (sensorRangeMin/Max/Unit) for accurate pressure-to-height conversions.

#### Pressure Sensor (Bottom-Mounted)
Used for sensors like the Dwyer 626-06-CB-P1-E5-S1 (0-5 PSI) mounted near the bottom of the tank.

- **Current Loop Type**: "pressure"
- **How it works**: Measures the pressure of the liquid column above the sensor
  - 4mA = `sensorRangeMin` (e.g., 0 PSI = no liquid above sensor)
  - 20mA = `sensorRangeMax` (e.g., 5 PSI = max liquid height)
- **Sensor Range**: The native measurement range from the sensor datasheet
  - `sensorRangeMin`: Minimum pressure at 4mA (typically 0)
  - `sensorRangeMax`: Maximum pressure at 20mA (e.g., 5 for 0-5 PSI)
  - `sensorRangeUnit`: Pressure unit - "PSI", "bar", "kPa", "mbar", or "inH2O"
- **Sensor Mount Height**: Height of sensor above tank bottom (usually 0-2 inches)

**Known Limitation - Blind Spot:** Pressure sensors cannot detect liquid levels below their mount height. When the tank is empty (0 PSI), the reported level will be the sensor mount height (e.g., 2"), not 0". Mount the sensor as close to the tank bottom as possible to minimize this blind spot.

**Pressure-to-Height Conversion:**
The system automatically converts pressure to inches using these factors:
- 1 PSI = 27.68 inches of water
- 1 bar = 401.5 inches of water
- 1 kPa = 4.015 inches of water
- 1 mbar = 0.4015 inches of water
- 1 inH2O = 1 inch of water

**Example Configuration** (0-5 PSI sensor on 120" tank):
- Sensor mounted 2 inches above tank bottom
- Max sensor range = 5 PSI = ~138 inches of water column
- Configuration:
  - `currentLoopType`: "pressure"
  - `sensorRangeMin`: 0
  - `sensorRangeMax`: 5
  - `sensorRangeUnit`: "PSI"
  - `sensorMountHeight`: 2.0

**How It Works:**
1. 4mA → 0 PSI → 0 inches of liquid above sensor
2. Total height = 0 + 2" mount height = 2" (minimum reported value due to blind spot)
3. When tank fills: 12mA → 2.5 PSI → 69.2" + 2" = 71.2" total

#### Ultrasonic Sensor (Top-Mounted)
Used for sensors like the Siemens Sitrans LU240 mounted on top of the tank looking down.

- **Current Loop Type**: "ultrasonic"
- **How it works**: Measures the distance from the sensor to the liquid surface
  - 4mA = `sensorRangeMin` (minimum distance, typically a blind spot)
  - 20mA = `sensorRangeMax` (maximum measurable distance)
- **Sensor Range**: The native measurement range from the sensor datasheet
  - `sensorRangeMin`: Minimum distance at 4mA (e.g., 0.5m for blind spot)
  - `sensorRangeMax`: Maximum distance at 20mA (e.g., 10m)
  - `sensorRangeUnit`: Distance unit - "m", "cm", "ft", or "in"
- **Sensor Mount Height**: Distance from sensor to tank bottom when tank is empty (in inches)

**Distance Unit Conversion:**
The system automatically converts distance to inches using:
- 1 m = 39.3701 inches
- 1 cm = 0.393701 inches
- 1 ft = 12 inches

**Example Configuration** (ultrasonic sensor with 0.5-10m range on 10-foot tank):
- Sensor mounted 124 inches above tank bottom (tank is 120" + 4" clearance)
- Configuration:
  - `currentLoopType`: "ultrasonic"
  - `sensorRangeMin`: 0.5 (blind spot in meters)
  - `sensorRangeMax`: 10.0 (max range in meters)
  - `sensorRangeUnit`: "m"
  - `sensorMountHeight`: 124.0

**How It Works:**
1. 4mA → 0.5m (19.7") → liquid level = 124" - 19.7" = 104.3" (nearly full)
2. 20mA → 10m (393.7") → liquid level = 124" - 393.7" = clamped to 0" (empty/beyond range)

**Calibration Tips for 4-20mA Sensors:**
1. Record the actual mA output at known liquid levels (empty, half-full, full)
2. Verify sensor mount height is accurate using a tape measure
3. Enter the correct sensor native range (as specified in sensor datasheet)
4. For pressure sensors: account for specific gravity if not measuring water (multiply PSI by 1.0/SG)
5. Check for temperature effects on readings (cold liquids are denser)

### Float Switch Configuration (Digital Sensors)
Float switches can be configured as either normally-open (NO) or normally-closed (NC):

- **Digital Switch Mode**: "NO" (normally-open) or "NC" (normally-closed)
  - **NO (Normally-Open)**: Switch is open by default, closes when fluid reaches the switch position
  - **NC (Normally-Closed)**: Switch is closed by default, opens when fluid reaches the switch position
- **Digital Trigger**: When to trigger the alarm
  - "activated": Alarm when switch is activated (fluid present)
  - "not_activated": Alarm when switch is not activated (fluid absent)

**Wiring Note**: For both NO and NC float switches, connect the switch between the digital input pin and GND. The Arduino uses an internal pull-up resistor, and the software interprets the signal based on your configured switch mode. The wiring is the same for both modes - only the software interpretation changes.

### Analog Voltage Sensor Configuration

For analog voltage sensors (like the Dwyer 626 series with voltage output), the system supports the same native range configuration as 4-20mA sensors. This allows you to specify both the voltage range and pressure range for accurate pressure-to-height conversion.

**Supported Voltage Output Configurations:**
- 0-10V (default)
- 0-5V
- 1-5V  
- 0.5-4.5V
- 2-10V
- Any configurable range

**Configuration Parameters:**
- `analogVoltageMin`: Minimum voltage output (e.g., 0.0 for 0-10V, 1.0 for 1-5V)
- `analogVoltageMax`: Maximum voltage output (e.g., 10.0 for 0-10V, 5.0 for 1-5V)
- `sensorRangeMin` / `sensorRangeMax`: Pressure range in native units
- `sensorRangeUnit`: Pressure unit - "PSI", "bar", "kPa", "mbar", or "inH2O"
- `sensorMountHeight`: Height of sensor above tank bottom (inches)

**Example Configuration** (Dwyer 626 with 1-5V output, 0-5 PSI range):
- Configuration:
  - `sensorType`: "analog"
  - `analogVoltageMin`: 1.0
  - `analogVoltageMax`: 5.0
  - `sensorRangeMin`: 0
  - `sensorRangeMax`: 5
  - `sensorRangeUnit`: "PSI"
  - `sensorMountHeight`: 2.0

### Hall Effect RPM Sensor Configuration

Hall effect sensors can be used to measure RPM (rotations per minute) for applications such as pump monitoring, motor speed tracking, or flow measurement. The system supports multiple types of hall effect sensors and detection methods.

**Sensor Types:**

1. **Unipolar** (default)
   - Triggered by a single magnetic pole (usually South pole)
   - Resets when magnetic field is removed
   - Output: Active LOW when magnet present, HIGH when absent
   - Use case: Simple magnet detection, one pulse per rotation

2. **Bipolar (Latching)**
   - Requires South pole to turn ON and North pole to turn OFF
   - Maintains state until opposite pole is detected
   - Output: Latches between HIGH and LOW states
   - Use case: Motor applications, precise position sensing

3. **Omnipolar**
   - Responds to either North or South pole
   - Simplifies magnet placement and orientation
   - Output: Toggles on any magnetic field
   - Use case: Flexible installations, bidirectional sensing

4. **Analog (Linear)**
   - Outputs voltage proportional to magnetic field strength
   - Can be used in digital threshold mode
   - Output: Voltage varies with field strength
   - Use case: Distance or angle measurement, fuel gauges

**Detection Methods:**

1. **Pulse Counting** (default)
   - Counts all pulses over a configurable sampling period (default 60 seconds)
   - More accurate for steady speeds
   - Averages multiple revolutions for better precision
   - Formula: RPM = (pulses × 60000) / (sample_duration_ms × pulses_per_rev)
   - Minimum detectable RPM = 60000 / (sample_duration_ms × pulses_per_rev)
     - With 60s sampling and 1 pulse/rev: minimum 1 RPM

2. **Time-Based**
   - Measures the period between two consecutive pulses
   - More responsive to speed changes
   - Works with fewer pulses (minimum 2)
   - More flexible for different magnet types and orientations
   - Formula: RPM = 60000 / (period_ms × pulses_per_rev)

3. **Accumulated Mode** (for very low RPM < 1)
   - Counts pulses between telemetry reports (e.g., 30 minutes)
   - Enable with `rpmAccumulatedMode: true`
   - Ideal for slow-moving pumps, flow meters, or agitators
   - Formula: RPM = (accumulated_pulses × 60000) / (elapsed_ms × pulses_per_rev)
   - With sampleSeconds=1800 (30 min) and 1 pulse/rev: detects down to 0.033 RPM

**Configuration Parameters:**
- `sensorType`: "rpm"
- `rpmPin`: Digital input pin for hall effect sensor (uses internal pull-up)
- `pulsesPerRevolution`: Number of pulses generated per complete rotation (default: 1)
  - Single magnet: 1 pulse per revolution
  - Multiple magnets: Set to number of magnets
  - **Note:** For **bipolar** or **omnipolar** sensors, a single magnet generates 2 pulses per revolution (one for each pole). Set `pulsesPerRevolution` to `2 × number of magnets` in these cases.
- `hallEffectType`: Sensor type - "unipolar", "bipolar", "omnipolar", or "analog"
- `hallEffectDetection`: Detection method - "pulse" or "time"
- `rpmSampleDurationMs`: Sample duration in milliseconds (default: 60000 = 60 seconds)
  - Longer durations detect lower RPM but increase measurement time
  - For 0.1 RPM detection without accumulated mode: use 600000 (10 minutes)
- `rpmAccumulatedMode`: Set to `true` for very low RPM measurement (< 1 RPM)
  - Counts pulses between telemetry reports instead of during a fixed sample window
  - Best for applications where RPM is very slow (e.g., 0.1 RPM = 1 rotation per 10 minutes)
- `highAlarm`: Maximum expected RPM for alarm (e.g., 3000)
- `lowAlarm`: Minimum expected RPM for alarm (e.g., 100)

**Example Configuration** (Motor monitoring with 4 magnets):
```json
{
  "sensor": "rpm",
  "rpmPin": 2,
  "pulsesPerRev": 8,
  "hallEffectType": "omnipolar",
  "hallEffectDetection": "time",
  "highAlarm": 3000,
  "lowAlarm": 500
}
```
Note: With omnipolar sensor and 4 magnets, use pulsesPerRev = 8 (2 pulses per magnet × 4 magnets)

**Example Configuration** (Slow pump flow meter - 0.1 RPM detection):
```json
{
  "sensor": "rpm",
  "rpmPin": 3,
  "pulsesPerRev": 1,
  "hallEffectType": "unipolar",
  "hallEffectDetection": "pulse",
  "rpmAccumulatedMode": true,
  "highAlarm": 10,
  "lowAlarm": 0.05
}
```
Note: With accumulated mode enabled and 30-minute sample intervals, this can detect down to 0.033 RPM

**Wiring:**
- Connect hall effect sensor VCC to 5V or 3.3V (check sensor datasheet)
- Connect sensor GND to Arduino GND
- Connect sensor output to configured digital pin
- No external pull-up needed (Arduino uses internal pull-up)

**Tips:**
- Use "time" detection for faster response to speed changes
- Use "pulse" detection for better accuracy at steady speeds
- Use `rpmAccumulatedMode: true` for very slow rotation (< 1 RPM)
- For multiple magnets, set `pulsesPerRev` to the number of magnets
- For omnipolar sensors, each magnet passing creates 2 pulses (both N and S poles trigger)
- Monitor both high and low thresholds to detect over-speed and stall conditions

## Operation

### Normal Operation
