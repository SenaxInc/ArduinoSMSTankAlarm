# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Tank Alarm Configuration File (Per-Tank)
#
# Instructions:
# 1. Create one .cfg file for EACH tank you want to monitor.
# 2. Place all .cfg files in the root of the SD card.
# 3. The filename can be anything (e.g., "Tank1.cfg", "North_Farm_Diesel.cfg").
# 4. Each file MUST contain the required settings below.
# 5. Remove the '#' to uncomment a setting you want to use.
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

# -- Required Settings --

# Site & Tank Identification
# Used for server-side grouping and log file naming.
SITE_NAME = North Farm
TANK_NUMBER = 101

# Physical Tank Dimensions
# Total height of the tank in inches.
TANK_HEIGHT_INCHES = 120

# Alarm Thresholds
# Level in inches at which to trigger a high or low level alarm.
HIGH_ALARM_INCHES = 108
LOW_ALARM_INCHES = 12

# -- Sensor Configuration (Choose ONE) --

# Option 1: Digital Float Switch
# The digital pin connected to the float switch.
# The system will read this pin. HIGH means alarm (full), LOW means normal (not full).
# DIGITAL_PIN = 7

# Option 2: Analog Voltage Sensor (0.5V - 4.5V)
# The analog pin (e.g., A0, A1) connected to the sensor.
# Use the pin number only (e.g., "1" for A1).
# ANALOG_PIN = 1

# Option 3: 4-20mA Current Loop Sensor (via I2C)
# The channel number (0-3) on the NCD.io I2C board.
# CURRENT_LOOP_CHANNEL = 0

# -- Optional Settings --

# Contact Information (Global - only needs to be in one .cfg file)
# Phone numbers for SMS alerts and daily reports.
ALARM_PHONE_PRIMARY = +12223334444
ALARM_PHONE_SECONDARY = +15556667777
DAILY_REPORT_PHONE = +18889990000

# Hologram.io Keys (Global - only needs to be in one .cfg file)
# Your device-specific key from the Hologram.io dashboard.
HOLOGRAM_DEVICE_KEY = your_device_key_here
SERVER_DEVICE_KEY = server_device_key_here

# Timing and Reporting
# How often to send a daily report (in hours, e.g., 24 for once a day).
DAILY_REPORT_HOURS = 24
# The time of day to send the report (24-hour format, e.g., "05:00").
DAILY_REPORT_TIME = 05:00

# Large Decrease Detection
# Threshold in inches for detecting a sudden drop in level.
LARGE_DECREASE_THRESHOLD = 24.0
# How many hours to wait after a large decrease before sending another alert.
LARGE_DECREASE_WAIT_HOURS = 2

# Power Management
# Enable deep sleep for maximum power saving.
DEEP_SLEEP_MODE = false
# How many minutes to sleep between checks in normal mode.
NORMAL_SLEEP_HOURS = 1
# How many minutes to sleep when actively monitoring (e.g., during an alarm).
SHORT_SLEEP_MINUTES = 10

# -- Calibration Points (Optional but Recommended) --
# Add points to map raw sensor readings to actual measured heights.
# Format: CAL_POINT = sensor_reading,height_in_inches
# At least two points are required for interpolation.
# The client will automatically add new points here when you use the "CAL" SMS command.
#
# Example for an Analog Voltage Sensor (0.5V = 0", 4.5V = 120"):
# CAL_POINT = 0.50,0.0
# CAL_POINT = 4.50,120.0
#
# Example for a 4-20mA Sensor (4mA = 0", 20mA = 120"):
# CAL_POINT = 4.0,0.0
# CAL_POINT = 20.0,120.0
