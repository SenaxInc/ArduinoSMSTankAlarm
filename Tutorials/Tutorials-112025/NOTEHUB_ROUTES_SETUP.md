## Background: How Blues Notecard Routing Works

Before we set up routes, let's understand the key rules of Blues Notecard communication:

### Notefile Naming Rules

| Extension | Direction | API | Example |
|-----------|-----------|-----|---------|
| `.qo` | **Outbound** (device → Notehub) | `note.add` | `telemetry.qo` |
| `.qi` | **Inbound** (Notehub → device) | `note.get` | `config.qi` |

**Critical rules:**
- `note.add` **only** accepts `.qo`, `.qos`, `.db`, `.dbs`, or `.dbx` as the `file` parameter
- `note.get` reads from `.qi`, `.qis`, `.db`, or `.dbx` files
- **Colons (`:`) are never allowed** in notefile names — they will cause firmware errors
- A device cannot directly write to another device's `.qi` file — that's what Routes are for!

### The Route Relay Pattern

Since devices can't write directly to each other, we use **Notehub Routes** as the relay:

```
┌─────────┐   note.add     ┌──────────┐   Route (HTTP)   ┌──────────┐   note.get
│  Client  │ ──────────────>│  Notehub │ ────────────────>│  Notehub │ ──────────>│  Server  │
│  Device  │  telemetry.qo  │  Cloud   │  Device API POST │  Cloud   │  telemetry.qi
└─────────┘                 └──────────┘                  └──────────┘
```

1. The **Client** calls `note.add` with `file: "telemetry.qo"`
2. The note syncs to **Notehub** cloud
3. A **Route** catches the event and uses the Notehub Device API to add a `.qi` note to the **Server** device
4. The **Server** calls `note.get` with `file: "telemetry.qi"` and reads the data

This is the "Route Relay" pattern — and it's the foundation of TankAlarm's communication.

---

## Architecture Overview

TankAlarm uses **5 routes** total:

| # | Route Name | Purpose | Trigger | Target |
|---|-----------|---------|---------|--------|
| 1 | **ClientToServerRelay** | Delivers client telemetry/alarms to server | 9 specific client `.qo` notefiles | Server device `.qi` inbox |
| 2 | **ServerToClientRelay** | Delivers server commands to clients | `command.qo` from server device | Target client's `.qi` inbox |
| 3 | **ServerToViewerRelay** | Delivers viewer summary to viewer devices | `viewer_summary.qo` from server | Viewer device `.qi` inbox |
| 4 | **SMSRoute** | Sends SMS alerts | `sms.qo` from server device | Twilio or Blues SMS |
| 5 | **EmailRoute** | Sends email reports | `email.qo` from server device | SMTP or Blues Email |

                                 email.qo ──> Route #5 ──> SMTP Email
```

### Relay Forwarding Flow (Client → Server → Client)

When a client alarm triggers relays on a remote client, the command flows through the server:

```
CLIENT A (alarm)                 SERVER                          CLIENT B (target)
────────────────                 ──────                          ────────────────
alarm triggers            relay_forward.qi                       relay.qi
relay_forward.qo ──>      handleRelayForward()                   pollForRelayCommands()
  Route #1          ──>     reads target, relay, state    ──>     activates relay
                            re-issues via command.qo
                              Route #2 delivers
```

This ensures the server has full visibility into all relay commands and can log/audit them.

---

## Step 1: Create a Notehub API Token

Routes #1, #2, and #3 use the Notehub Device API to add notes to specific devices. This requires authentication.

1. Log in to [notehub.io](https://notehub.io)
2. Click your **profile icon** (top right) → **Account Settings**
3. Click **API Tokens** in the left sidebar
4. Click **Generate new token**
5. Name it: `TankAlarm Route Relay`
6. Copy the token — you'll need it for the routes below

> **⚡ Tip:** Store this token securely. You can always regenerate it, but all routes using the old token will break.

---

## Step 2: Note Your Device UIDs

You'll need the Notecard device UIDs for your Server and Viewer devices. Find them in Notehub:

1. Go to your **TankAlarm project** in Notehub
2. Click **Devices** in the left sidebar
3. Note the **Device UID** for each device (format: `dev:XXXXXXXXXXXX`)

Write them down:

| Role | Device UID | Fleet |
|------|-----------|-------|
| Server | `dev:_____________` | `tankalarm-server` |
| Viewer | `dev:_____________` | `tankalarm-viewer` |
| Client 1 | `dev:_____________` | `tankalarm-clients` (or your client fleet) |
| Client 2 | `dev:_____________` | `tankalarm-clients` (or your client fleet) |

> **⚡ Note:** The viewer firmware automatically joins the `tankalarm-viewer` fleet via `hub.set`. Make sure this fleet exists in your Notehub project before provisioning viewer devices.

---

## Step 3: Create Route #1 — ClientToServerRelay

This route catches all `.qo` events from client devices and delivers them as `.qi` notes to the server.

### 3a. Navigate to Routes

1. In your Notehub project, click **Routes** in the left sidebar
2. Click **Create Route**
3. Select **General HTTP/HTTPS Request/Response**

### 3b. Configure the Route

| Setting | Value |
|---------|-------|
| **Route Name** | `ClientToServerRelay` |
| **URL** | `https://api.notefile.net/v1/projects/YOUR_PROJECT_UID/devices/YOUR_SERVER_DEVICE_UID/notes/{{notefile_base}}.qi` |
| **HTTP Method** | `POST` |
| **HTTP Headers** | `Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_TOKEN` |
|                  | `Content-Type: application/json` |

Replace the placeholders:
- `YOUR_PROJECT_UID` → Your Notehub project UID (found in project settings, format: `app:XXXX`)
- `YOUR_SERVER_DEVICE_UID` → The server's device UID (e.g., `dev:123456789012`)
- `YOUR_API_TOKEN` → The API token from Step 1

### 3c. Configure the Request Body

Set the **Body** to use a JSONata transform:

```jsonata
{
    "body": body
}
```

This passes the entire event body through to the server's `.qi` notefile.

### 3d. Configure Event Filters

| Setting | Value |
|---------|-------|
| **Fleets** | Select your **client fleet** only |
| **Notefiles** | `telemetry.qo`, `alarm.qo`, `daily.qo`, `unload.qo`, `serial_log.qo`, `serial_ack.qo`, `config_ack.qo`, `location_response.qo`, `relay_forward.qo` |

> **⚡ Tip:** The `{{notefile_base}}` template variable extracts the base name without the extension. So `telemetry.qo` becomes `telemetry`, and the URL appends `.qi` — resulting in the note being added to `telemetry.qi` on the server.

> **⚡ Important:** Do not include `config.qo` — it does not exist. Config is delivered to clients via `command.qo` with `_type: config`, and clients acknowledge via `config_ack.qo`.

### 3e. Save and Test

1. Click **Save Route**
2. Send a test telemetry note from a client device
3. Check the **Route Logs** to verify delivery
4. Check the server's **Events** page to see the `.qi` note appear

---

## Step 4: Create Route #2 — ServerToClientRelay

This is the most sophisticated route. The server sends ALL commands through a single `command.qo` notefile, and the route reads metadata in the body to determine which client and which `.qi` file to deliver to.

### 4a. Create the Route

1. Click **Routes** → **Create Route** → **General HTTP/HTTPS Request/Response**

| Setting | Value |
|---------|-------|
| **Route Name** | `ServerToClientRelay` |
| **URL** | See JSONata below |
| **HTTP Method** | `POST` |
| **HTTP Headers** | `Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_TOKEN` |
|                  | `Content-Type: application/json` |

### 4b. Configure the Dynamic URL

The URL must be **dynamic** because each command targets a different client device and notefile. Use a **JSONata expression** for the URL:

```jsonata
"https://api.notefile.net/v1/projects/" & $PROJECTUID & "/devices/" & body._target & "/notes/" & (
    body._type = "config" ? "config.qi" :
    body._type = "relay" ? "relay.qi" :
    body._type = "serial_request" ? "serial_request.qi" :
    body._type = "location_request" ? "location_request.qi" :
    "command.qi"
)
```

> **Note:** Replace `$PROJECTUID` with your actual project UID string, e.g., `"app:XXXXXXXXXXXX"`.

### 4c. Configure the Request Body

Use JSONata to strip the routing metadata and pass only the command payload:

```jsonata
{
    "body": $merge([body, {"_target": $nothing, "_type": $nothing}])
}
```

This removes `_target` and `_type` from the body before delivering to the client — the client doesn't need to see routing metadata.

### 4d. Configure Event Filters

| Setting | Value |
|---------|-------|
| **Fleets** | Select your **server fleet** only |
| **Notefiles** | `command.qo` |

### 4e. Save and Test

1. Click **Save Route**
2. From the server dashboard, send a config update to a client
3. Check **Route Logs** — you should see the dynamic URL targeting the correct client device
4. On the client, verify the `config.qi` note arrived

---

## Step 5: Create Route #3 — ServerToViewerRelay

This route delivers the viewer summary from the server to all viewer devices.

### 5a. Create the Route

| Setting | Value |
|---------|-------|
| **Route Name** | `ServerToViewerRelay` |
| **URL** | `https://api.notefile.net/v1/projects/YOUR_PROJECT_UID/devices/YOUR_VIEWER_DEVICE_UID/notes/viewer_summary.qi` |
| **HTTP Method** | `POST` |
| **HTTP Headers** | `Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_TOKEN` |
|                  | `Content-Type: application/json` |

### 5b. Request Body

```jsonata
{
    "body": body
}
```

### 5c. Event Filters

| Setting | Value |
|---------|-------|
| **Fleets** | Select your **server fleet** only |
| **Notefiles** | `viewer_summary.qo` |

### 5d. Multiple Viewers

If you have multiple viewer devices, you need **one route per viewer** — duplicate this route for each viewer device UID, changing only the `YOUR_VIEWER_DEVICE_UID` in the URL.

> **Why not fleet-level delivery?** The Notehub Device API (`/v1/projects/{project}/devices/{device}/notes/{notefile}`) requires a specific device UID. There is no fleet-level broadcast endpoint. Each viewer needs its own route.

For most deployments (1–2 viewers), this is simple to manage. If you have many viewers, consider scripting route creation via the [Notehub API](https://dev.blues.io/api-reference/notehub-api/).

> **Fleet membership still matters:** All viewers should join the `tankalarm-viewer` fleet (the firmware does this automatically). This enables fleet-scoped DFU updates, device grouping in the Notehub UI, and future fleet-level features.

---

## Step 6: Create Route #4 — SMS Alerts (Optional)

If you're using SMS alerts, create a route for the `sms.qo` notefile. This connects to your SMS provider (Twilio, Blues SMS, etc.).

### For Twilio:

| Setting | Value |
|---------|-------|
| **Route Name** | `SMSRoute` |
| **Route Type** | **Twilio SMS** |
| **Account SID** | Your Twilio Account SID |
| **Auth Token** | Your Twilio Auth Token |
| **From Number** | Your Twilio phone number |
| **Notefiles** | `sms.qo` |

### For Blues SMS (Notehub built-in):

Notehub has built-in SMS support — check the [Blues documentation](https://dev.blues.io) for details.

---

## Step 7: Create Route #5 — Email Reports (Optional)

| Setting | Value |
|---------|-------|
| **Route Name** | `EmailRoute` |
| **Route Type** | **SMTP Email** or **General HTTP** to your email service |
| **Notefiles** | `email.qo` |

Configure according to your email provider's requirements.

## Troubleshooting

### "Route returned 4xx error"

| Error Code | Meaning | Fix |
|-----------|---------|-----|
| 401 | Unauthorized | Check your API token is correct and not expired |
| 404 | Device not found | Verify the device UID is correct and the device exists in the project |
| 400 | Bad request | Check the request body format — must be valid JSON with a `body` field |

### "Notes not appearing on target device"

1. **Check Route Logs** in Notehub — do you see the route firing?
2. **Check fleet assignment** — is the source device in the correct fleet for the route filter?
3. **Check notefile filter** — does the route's notefile filter match the exact `.qo` filename?
4. **Check the target device** — is it set to `continuous` or `periodic` mode? The device must sync to receive notes.

### "notefile names may not include a : character"

This error means your firmware still has old `device:uid:file.qi` or `fleet:name:file.qi` patterns. Update to the latest firmware — see the [Firmware Update Guide](FIRMWARE_UPDATE_GUIDE.md).

### "note.add file must be .qo, .qos, .db, .dbs, or .dbx"

Your firmware is trying to `note.add` with a `.qi` filename. Only `.qo` extensions work for outbound notes. Check that your notefile `#define` values use `.qo` for outbound files.

---

## Understanding the command.qo Pattern

The server uses a **single consolidated outbox** (`command.qo`) for all outbound commands. Each note includes routing metadata in the body:

```json
{
    "_target": "dev:123456789012",
    "_type": "config",
    "site": "North Tank Farm",
    "sampleSeconds": 1800,
    "tanks": [...]
}
```

| Field | Purpose | Values |
|-------|---------|--------|
| `_target` | Device UID of the target client | `dev:XXXXXXXXXXXX` |
| `_type` | Command type — determines which `.qi` file to deliver to | `config`, `relay`, `serial_request`, `location_request` |

The ServerToClientRelay Route reads these fields to construct the correct API URL.

### Why a single command.qo?

- **Fewer routes** — one route handles all server→client communication
- **Simpler firmware** — server always writes to the same notefile
- **Easier debugging** — all commands are visible in one place in Notehub
- **Relay forwarding** — when a client alarm triggers relays on another client, the request flows through the server via `relay_forward.qo` → Route #1 → `relay_forward.qi` (server) → `handleRelayForward()` re-issues via `command.qo` → Route #2 → target client `relay.qi`. This gives the server full visibility and audit capability.

### Serial Request/ACK Handshake

When the server requests serial logs from a client:

1. Server sends `serial_request` via `command.qo` → Route #2 → client `serial_request.qi`
2. Client receives request → sends `serial_ack.qo` with `{"status": "processing"}` → Route #1 → server `serial_ack.qi`
3. Client uploads logs via `serial_log.qo` → Route #1 → server `serial_log.qi`
4. Client sends `serial_ack.qo` with `{"status": "complete"}` → Route #1 → server `serial_ack.qi`

The server dashboard displays the ACK status in real time, providing feedback on whether the client has received and processed the request.

### Config ACK Protocol

When the server pushes config to a client, a version-tracked ACK handshake ensures delivery:

1. Server generates a config version hash (e.g., `"A3F2B1C0"`) and injects it as `_cv` in the config payload
2. Server sends config via `command.qo` → Route #2 → client `config.qi`
3. Client applies config → sends `config_ack.qo` with `{"client": "dev:...", "status": "applied", "cv": "A3F2B1C0"}` → Route #1 → server `config_ack.qi`
4. Server matches `cv` against the stored version — if they match, `pendingDispatch` is cleared and retries stop

If the ACK version doesn't match (e.g., client applied an older config), the server continues retrying until the correct version is acknowledged.

### Fleet Architecture

TankAlarm uses three fleets:

| Fleet | Devices | hub.set Fleet |
|-------|---------|---------------|
| `tankalarm-server` | Server nodes | Set in server's `hub.set` (configurable) |
| `tankalarm-clients` | Client nodes | Set via config push from server |
| `tankalarm-viewer` | Viewer nodes | Hardcoded in viewer's `hub.set` |

Fleet membership is used for:
- **Route source filtering** — Routes #1 and #2 fire only for events from specific fleets
- **DFU targeting** — firmware updates can be deployed per-fleet
- **Device management** — Notehub UI groups devices by fleet
- **Route #3 scoping** — the server fleet filter ensures only server-originated viewer summaries are routed

---

## Cost and Data Usage

| Route | Events/Day (typical) | Data per Event | Daily Total |
|-------|---------------------|---------------|-------------|
| ClientToServerRelay | ~50–60 per client (telemetry @ 1/30min + alarms, daily, unloads, config ACKs, serial, location) | ~200–500 bytes | ~15 KB/client |
| ServerToClientRelay | 1–5 (config/relay/serial request/location request) | ~500 bytes | ~2.5 KB |
| ServerToViewerRelay | 4 (every 6 hours) | ~2 KB | ~8 KB |
| SMS | 0–10 (alarm dependent) | ~160 bytes | ~1.6 KB |
| Email | 1 (daily report) | ~2 KB | ~2 KB |

**Total:** ~30 KB/day per client node. Well within Blues free tier (5,000 events/month).
